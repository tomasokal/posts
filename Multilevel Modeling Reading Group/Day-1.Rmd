# Notes

## Random Effects

Hierarchical structures in data can be be seen in terms of levels. Level 1 has individuals or points that vary in time. Level 2 has structures that nest Level 1 individuals but are time invariant. Pooled linear regression models will assume that residuals are independently distrubuted. Once all covariates are considered, there are no correlation nor depedence between measures. Thus, this approach will view any Level 2 structure as identical which can be unreasonable. Measurement of Level 1 individuals within a Level 2 structure will be related to one another. Standard errors will be incorrect and biased if this is not taken into account.

RE solution is to partition unexplained residual variance into both Level 1 and Level 2 variance.

$$\y_{ij} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}*x_{1ij} + \beta_{2}*Z_{j} + (u_{j} + e_{ij})
